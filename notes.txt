----
random should technically work unfortunately there is essentially a limit of 10.000 songs
therefore, to get around this, i randomize the way the 10.000 results are
sorted.
its not the best solution but because theres no way to request a result that
lives past page 201, or to start a search from page 201, it seems the only way for now
this also provides some rationale to develop the feature to select by genre more
because genres will be smaller than the total number of albums on discog (~2mil)

requirements are bloated cuz i didnt use a different virtual env
