notes
----
requirements are bloated cuz i didnt use a different virtual env

consider: what to do with albums with no yt link?
i think theyre still valid, but it kind of negates the one click "spin the
record" experience
these typically do have a soundcloud, yt, or bandcamp presence, if not of
the full album listed
